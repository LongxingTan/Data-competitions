# 第二届工业互联网算法大赛-装备赛道

I will briefly introduce my solution here.

## Key of this competition
- Be familar with data minimg. Because it's a 7days quick competition, with complex data and lots of sub-task
- Explore tha data, find the pattern manually, transfer the pattern into feature, validate the prediction


## Key of my solution 
- Find the pattern from visualization, then transfer it to feature. So I try to label the data manually first, then I use the model to learn my label. It's just an ugly trick, which works here for few test cases, but doesn't work for real application.
- Don't give up, but luck is not on my side this time.
